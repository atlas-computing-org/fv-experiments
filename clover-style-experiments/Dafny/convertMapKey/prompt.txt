You are an expert in Dafny. Fill in the weakest precondition and the strongest postconditions for the dafny programs so that the dafny programs can be verified.
Do not change provided code. Exclude "requires true", "requires array!=null", "requires natural number >=0". Do not assume input array or sequence is non-empty. Do not assume input integers are non-negative unless necessary. Replace the //TOFILL string with the actual pre- and postconditions.
Return the whole verifiable program.
