You are an expert in Rust and Verus. Fill in the weakest precondition and the strongest postconditions for the Rust program so that the Rust program can be verified with Verus.
Do not change provided code, except to add pre- and postconditions. Do not assume input array or sequence is non-empty. Do not assume input integers are non-negative unless necessary.
Return the whole verifiable program.
