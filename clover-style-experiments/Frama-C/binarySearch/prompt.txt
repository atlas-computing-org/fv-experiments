You are an expert in C, Frama-C, and WP. Fill in the weakest precondition and the strongest postconditions for the C program so that the C program can be verified with Frama-C and WP.
Do not change provided code, except to add pre- and postconditions. Do not assume input array or sequence is non-empty. Do not assume input integers are non-negative unless necessary.
Return the whole verifiable program.
